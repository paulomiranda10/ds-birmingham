The goal with this jupyter notebook is to analyze the purchase card transactions for the Birmingham City Concil and find insights over this database.

I take step by step the process of:

- merge all datasets from years and months
- remove null values, padronize the categorical values
- apply cluster using elbow and silhouette methods
- apply forecasting


## Follow this steps to execute this jupyter notebook: 
- clone the repository into your local computer
- execute: venv_birmi\Scripts\activate.bat
- execute: jupyter notebook
- run each cell inside the jupyter notebook (some plots doesn't save the last state on it)

I choose to upload all libs to the git in order to facilitate the process of create a local environment, for that reason it may take more time than usual to download the repository.
